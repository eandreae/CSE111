I am working alone, not doing pair programming.
All of the work submitted here is code written by me,
except for code copied from the instructor's directories.

I have read and understood the UC Santa Cruz
Academic Misconduct Policy for Undergraduates.

As per professor Mackey's request:

Hi,

My name is Eric Andreae and I am currently in your CSE 111 fall 2020 
class. This is my second time taking this class with you, and during 
then I was working with a partner for asg3 onwards.

My code for asg3 and onwards functions as intended with a good score, 
so I am fully intending on re-submitting that code. However, I am 
unsure if I need to include a PARTNER file, even though my partner 
is not currently enrolled in the class this quarter.

Please let me know what I should do, since I do not want to 
accidentally trigger the cheating system of UCSC.

Thanks,
Eric

Professor Mackey's reply:

Since you are now working alone, your README should be the Solo 
programming one from pair-programming.

Add to the end of it the substance of your note and my reply.  
Submitting code written by your and your former partner for this 
assignment is not cheating.  Presumably it will include any 
improvements you may choose to make before submitting it.

Any score your received from last quarter will not be considered.  
Only code your submit this quarter will be considered as part of 
your current quarter trade.
